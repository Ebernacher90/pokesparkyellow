## Bugs/Glitches still in need of a fix
Palette for indoor maps not updating properly, probably my attempt at a night day system palette switch and the new tileset I inserted messed the all thing up

Pikas facepic palette is also messed up probably related with the previous issue

Implementing extra tiles blocks for tilesets, made the trainer card time display not showing the 2 dots anymore

Exiting from viewing the town map causes tile on the map to glitch and do not display properly

The palette switch for night n day system made so that certain interior maps, all the ones that are not in any town display a wrong palette for some unknown reason

Occasionaly Pikas sprite dissappears when passing certain tile block of the new tilesets

Ledges do not work as intended with the new inserted tilesets
